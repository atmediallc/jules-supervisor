# Jules Supervisor

> **Autonomous, Policy-Controlled AI Orchestration & Supervision Platform for Google Jules**

Jules Supervisor is an enterprise-grade control plane that continuously observes, analyzes, governs, and responds to Google Jules coding sessions through official Google Jules APIs and OpenAI-compatible AI providers (such as OmniRoute, GPT-4o, Claude, or Gemini).

---

## Key Features

- **Official Google Jules API Adapter**: Strongly typed, runtime Zod-validated adapter with exponential backoff, rate limiting, and failure classification.
- **Strict Execution Modes**: `DISABLED`, `DRY_RUN` (Default safe mode), `ASSISTED` (Human review), `AUTO_RESPOND` (Low-risk auto-replies), and `FULL_AUTO`.
- **Deterministic Policy & Risk Engine**: Hard safety veto rules that unconditionally override AI model output for destructive SQL, sensitive file paths, credential tampering, and recursion loops.
- **Prompt Injection Defense**: Repository and agent inputs are tagged as untrusted data (`<untrusted_context>`), isolated from system directives, and audited.
- **Idempotency & Concurrency Gate**: Deterministic SHA-256 idempotency keys and distributed locking prevent duplicate API actions or race conditions across multiple workers.
- **Modern Next.js Control Plane Dashboard**: Real-time KPI metrics, interactive Human Approval Queue with double-submission protection, session explorer, decision auditing, and Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Production-Ready Persistence & Queues**: PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), BullMQ worker queue with Redis coordination, and standalone in-memory fallbacks for offline testing.
- **Docker & NAS Ready**: Multi-stage lightweight Dockerfiles, Docker Compose stack, and dedicated Synology/TrueNAS runbooks.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm >= 9
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional for local full-stack)

### Running with Docker Compose

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/angelotejada/Jules-Supervisor.git
cd Jules-Supervisor

# 2. Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start PostgreSQL, Redis, Worker, and Web Dashboard
docker compose up -d

# 4. Access Web Control Plane
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run complete test suite (Unit, Integration, Security, Concurrency, Failure Injection)
npx vitest run

# Run TypeScript compile & strict typechecks
npx tsc --build

# Start Web Control Plane in dev mode
pnpm --filter @jules/web dev

# Start Worker Daemon in dev mode
pnpm --filter @jules/worker dev
```

## CI/CD & Health Checks

This project includes a GitHub Actions CI pipeline that runs on every push to `main` and `develop`, and on pull requests. The pipeline:
- Installs dependencies with pnpm
- Runs linting and type checking
- Executes the full test suite (`pnpm run test:ci`)
- Scans for security vulnerabilities with Trivy

Both the web dashboard and the worker expose health check endpoints:
- Web: `GET /api/health` (port 3000)
- Worker: `GET /health` (port 8080)

These endpoints are used by Docker Compose health checks to monitor container liveness.

## Load Testing

We use [k6](https://k6.io/) for load testing. To run the load test:

1. Install k6: https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/
2. Start the application (e.g., with `docker compose up -d`).
3. Run `pnpm run test:load` (or `k6 run tests/load/load-test.js`).

The load test simulates a moderate number of concurrent users and checks that the health endpoint responds quickly.
